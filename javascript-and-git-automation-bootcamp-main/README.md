# JavaScript & Git Assignment
# https://github.com/QualityWorksCG/javascript-and-git-automation-bootcamp

The "assignment" folder is where you will find all exercise that will have a similar makeup to what you did during the session. 

Even so, this will be a bit harder and you are expected to do any required research. For each exercise I will add tips where I believe it's needed but they won't be everywhere. 

Now let's get to it!

---

1. Fork this repo (5 marks)
2. Clone the repo locally and create a branch name [firstname]-[lastname]-assignment (5 marks)
3. Copy the "assignment" folder and paste it back to the root of the project and rename it to your name [firstname]-[lastname] (5 marks)
4. Since your folder will be self-contained, you have to switch directly so type "cd ./[firstname]-[lastname]" to start the assignment
5. Install all dependence to the project "npm install"
6. Each exercise is worth (10 marks)
    - While your main goal is to get the test cases passing for each exercise
    - You will be tested on creativity as well
    - There is no right or wrong way of solving a problem once it's solved
    - You can check each exercise with the following command `npm run exercise 01`
7. When you are completed with all exercise, you need to make a PR back to the main branch (5 marks)


All the best!
